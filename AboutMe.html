        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p class="AboutMeText">My name is Theo Haines i am a college student studying computer science and
            my favortite part of the subject is programming. I started programming at 14 and taught myself C# and
            started working on creating games in unity, the first game i've actually published is called balls
            and it was a simple score based clicker game. In my spare time I enjoy gaming and using a cnc lathe to
            cut wood patterns and i also enjoy using 3D printers. I got my first laptop at 9 and fell inlove with 
            anything to do with them, i used to take them apart (and never manage to put them back together) and wonder
            how they actually work. I always wanted to create a computer game ever since i got my first laptop but
            never had the means of doing so. Once i started learning unity i worked on many small projects but never published
            them because i'm a perfectionist and didn't want to release a unfinished project. A year later i started working on
            games in the roblox engine publising many buggy and unfinished games that i could play with my friends. Eventually
            i started working on websites and networking and i made my first website which i soon after removed from the web. Soon
            enougth i started going to college and made new friends and i worked on <a href="https://dylansavill.github.io/">my first website</a> 
            with a friend which is still accessable to this day. Its undeniably a really bad website but i really liked the charm
            behind it and how terribly designed it was yet how it still worked fairly well. This website is the second website i've 
            published and i'm already fairly happy with it.

            Aside from Computers some of my other intrests include camping and breaking bad / better call saul. i've always enjoyed 
            camping in the summer with my dad and his girlfriend although sometimes it can be rough i enjoy the outdoors and nature in general.  
            And breaking bad is one of my all time favortite tv shows and i could talk about it for hours i also really enjoy better call saul
            and saul is one of my favortite characters in fiction. As for my job i currently work for currys the largest uk tech retailer as a 
            store support colleage and help people with technology and its probally the best first job i could have gotten and i would reccomend
            anyone with any sales experience and a love for tech to work there. I also enjoy playing magic the gathering and i play it from time
            to time with friends.
