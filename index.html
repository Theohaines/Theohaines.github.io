        <h2>
            Hello! I'm Theo Haines, I'm web-designer and Photographer with sales experience. My interests include creating functional websites, gaming, music,
            photography and graphic design. I have my portfolio below so you can take a look at some of my work, my favourite project I've worked on so far is
            TotemSocial because it pushed me to come up with an engaging but understandable user interface. My current project is TotemSocial trying to find ways to
            make the site more engaging for users. My contact info is below as well as some links to my social accounts if you want to contact me. - Theo H

            <h3>
                TotemSocial is a joint project between me and a friend where we wanted to create a website where students could communicate freely and effectively. 
                It was a real challenge designing an interface that was easy to use but also had functionality. I wanted to use a dark mode interface because it puts
                less strain on the users eyes and also looks more sleek and 'modern'. I personally worked on the front end of the site (The look of the website and how
                the user interacts with it) as well as a limited part of the backend when needed. You can click <a href="https://TotemSocial.co.uk">This</a>

            <h3>
                YC-Movies was the first joint project I worked on with my friend, we wanted to see how easy it would be to make a video streaming site, The project is mostly
                abandoned now because it was mostly just a test to see how well we could make a site. Some of its core features was its invite only account system and the
                ability to search for certain videos. Again I worked on the front end for this website and I decided on a pink and black theme to make it really stand out, my
                main goal as the front end developer was to make the user experience as seemless as possible.

            <h3>
                Lufton-co was a solo college project I had to work on for my BTEC computing course, we needed to make a website for the lufton town hall and advertise it as
                a public space avaliable to hire. The website had a few design reqirements such as needing an about page, booking page, contact page and links to 3 other websites.
                My favourite thing about this website was the gradient background, I think it still felt professional whilst giving the website some personality which I think
                really makes it feel less corporate.
