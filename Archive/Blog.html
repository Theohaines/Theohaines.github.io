                    This is my second photography dump showcasing some of the photos i'm proud of, i've also setup a proton drive link to help users
                    see all my photos and videos! Also i just thought i should add the camera i own incase anyone is interested, i use a Nikon coolpix L840!
                    It's a really good camera and it has a 38X zoom which helps me get all the good photos of sunsets and sheep. Anyways thats all for now
                    thanks for visiting. - Theo

                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    So i finally got around to finishing the 2D-Platformer project i started a few
                    months back. The game features a few enemy types an online leaderboard (avaliable on .exe only)
                    and a few minutes of playtime. I intend to add alot more replayability to the game later on but
                    i really wanted to release the game to get some feedback and feature suggestions. You can play the
                    game on itch.io or download the .exe to enable online leaderboard functions.

                    <h3>| Planned features |</h3>
                    
                    <ul>

                        <li>Powerups</li>
                        <li>Permerment upgrades</li>
                        <li>and an in game soundtrack</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>| Final notes |</h3>

                    I will create a devlog for every major feature that gets released and also keep you guys included
                    in the development process. Thats all for now i hope you guys have as much fun playing the game as
                    i did making it - Theo

                    photos. With the introduction of photography dumps a filter system has
                    been added to the website to help users filter content.

                    This is a blog post going over the several major updates the website has

                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    The first major thing you will notice the second you open the website is the
                    changes to the colour pallet. I have gone for a grey colour for the new website
                    theme to make it appear more professional. The second major change is mobile support
                    (mostly!) I have massively improved mobile accessability and made a few quality of life changes.
                    Finally i have cleaned up alot of pages including the one you are on now and
                    intend to make more QOL changes in the future.
                </P>
                <h3>| Back end changes |</h3>
                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    I've made quite a few changes to the back end such as giving each page its own individual css
                    file to reduce website load times aswell as removing files that the website nolonger uses. Overrall
                    performance should have improved with this update so i hope the website is alot more enjoyable to use.

                    made and will also host any music i make aswell. I'm planning on adding
                    a photography page to the website to showcase some photos i've taken on my
                    camera as well as some information on where they where taken and when.
                    I'm also working on a small soap making business to bring in some extra cash
                    so i'll keep you guys updated on that when its done. The reason i've been gone
                    for a while is because I haven't been doing so well mentally recently
                    and needed to take a break to clear my head. I'm going
                    to get back to what i was doing before fairly soon so you guys should
                    start seeing more games appear on the games page when that happens. Thats
                    about all i have to say this time thanks for visiting my small corner of
                    the internet cya next time - Theo.

                   So its been a while, i haven't updated the blog 
                   in a long time so its about time i give you guys an update.
                   the 3D pipes screensaver has been cancelled due to limitations
                   with unity and how 'good' i am at c# i will probally give it
                   another try at some other point but for now its cancelled. As
                   for the platformer i announced in my last blog post i am still
                   working on it along with some smaller projects. i thought i would 
                   have a build done alot sooner than i did. I'm Currently working on
                   polising the game for a alpha release to get some feedback and
                   ideas for new features. In news other than game development I'm
                   working on a smart mirror and i will keep you guys posted on that.
                   Thats all for now see you next time - Theo

                    Recently i started work on a new game which doesnt have a name yet, it is a 2d platformer shooter with a minimalistic look
                    with all the game being built out of primitive shapes. The game will have an online leaderboard hosting the top 12 scores in game
                    as well as a leaderboard on the website. This is the first game i am really proud of and I can't wait to share it with you 
                    guys. I will create a itch.io page for the game soon and will release screenshots soon, I will also continue to update the game for
                    the following months after the games release and will continue to fix and add new features. Thats all for now hope you are looking
                    forward to it - Theo

                    in a few days and the project will be called "3D pipes". you can visit the project page using the link below and i 
                    will post devlogs on the progress of the development for the next few days. The software will have several features

                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    I have created a new web app/ app for android called VestaMessages designed after the product VestaBoard. Using VestaMessages you can create VestaBoard style messages and 
                    share them with friends. To send a message to a friend you can create your message on the app and then click export, clicking export will generate a string that you can copy 
                    and send to friends. All your friends need to do is paste the encoded string into the decoder box and click decode and it will play the message. Currently there isn't any 
                    support for emojis or coloured text although i have plans to try to add support in the future. You can access the app from the link below or by going to the games/software 
                    section of the website. Thats all for now, happy messaging - Theo
