            | Vesta Messages | <br><br>

            VestaMessages was the second ever public project I released. It was a software I made to emulate the design of the vestaboard, I wanted a way to share vestaboard style
            messages with my friends and so I created the solution. You can access it for free <a href="https://theohaines.itch.io/vestamessages">here</a>.

            The 2D puzzle platformer was a game I made last year, I wanted to design an interesting puzzle game within a week and so I designed this. I originally planned to update
            it with more content but I started work on other projects to I never finished new levels. You can access the game free <a href="https://theohaines.itch.io/2d-puzzle-platformer">here</a>.

            | Spotifeel | <br><br>

            Spotifeel is an online tool that allows users to display their feelings as a spotify song, I made this tool because I found that I best express myself and my
            feelings through music so I wanted to make an outlet to do that. You can access Spotifeel for free <a href="https://theohaines.xyz/Spotifeel">here</a>.
