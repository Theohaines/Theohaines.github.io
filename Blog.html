                    albums. It also has a button that links to my last fm page so you can check
                    out what i'm currently listening to and have previously listened to as well as
                    other statistics. Thats all for this update i'll have some game dev stuff

                    Welcome to my first of many photography dumps I will be doing on this
                    website. Each dump will contain a few heighlights from recently taken
                    photos. With the introduction of photography dumps a filter system has
                    been added to the website to help users filter content.

                    This is a blog post going over the several major updates the website has
                    gotten front end and backend.
                </P>
                <h3>| Front end changes |</h3>
                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    The first major thing you will notice the second you open the website is the
                    changes to the colour pallet. I have gone for a grey colour for the new website
                    theme to make it appear more professional. The second major change is mobile support
                    (mostly!) I have massively improved mobile accessability and made a few quality of life changes.
                    Finally i have cleaned up alot of pages including the one you are on now and
                    intend to make more QOL changes in the future.
                </P>
                <h3>| Back end changes |</h3>
                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    I've made quite a few changes to the back end such as giving each page its own individual css
                    file to reduce website load times aswell as removing files that the website nolonger uses. Overrall
                    performance should have improved with this update so i hope the website is alot more enjoyable to use.
                    Thats all for now have a good one - Theo

                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    Its been quite some time since I last updated the blog and the
                    website in general. Since the last blog post i've added a new
                    music tab to the website which showcases all the the playlists i've
                    made and will also host any music i make aswell. I'm planning on adding
                    a photography page to the website to showcase some photos i've taken on my
                    camera as well as some information on where they where taken and when.
                    I'm also working on a small soap making business to bring in some extra cash
                    so i'll keep you guys updated on that when its done. The reason i've been gone
                    for a while is because I haven't been doing so well mentally recently
                    and needed to take a break to clear my head. I'm going
                    to get back to what i was doing before fairly soon so you guys should
                    start seeing more games appear on the games page when that happens. Thats
                    about all i have to say this time thanks for visiting my small corner of
                    the internet cya next time - Theo.

                   So its been a while, i haven't updated the blog 
                   in a long time so its about time i give you guys an update.
                   the 3D pipes screensaver has been cancelled due to limitations
                   with unity and how 'good' i am at c# i will probally give it
                   another try at some other point but for now its cancelled. As
                   for the platformer i announced in my last blog post i am still
                   working on it along with some smaller projects. i thought i would 
                   have a build done alot sooner than i did. I'm Currently working on
                   polising the game for a alpha release to get some feedback and
                   ideas for new features. In news other than game development I'm
                   working on a smart mirror and i will keep you guys posted on that.

                    Recently i started work on a new game which doesnt have a name yet, it is a 2d platformer shooter with a minimalistic look
                    with all the game being built out of primitive shapes. The game will have an online leaderboard hosting the top 12 scores in game
                    as well as a leaderboard on the website. This is the first game i am really proud of and I can't wait to share it with you 
                    guys. I will create a itch.io page for the game soon and will release screenshots soon, I will also continue to update the game for
                    the following months after the games release and will continue to fix and add new features. Thats all for now hope you are looking
                    forward to it - Theo

                <P id="BlogParagraph">
                    I have created a new web app/ app for android called VestaMessages designed after the product VestaBoard. Using VestaMessages you can create VestaBoard style messages and 
                    share them with friends. To send a message to a friend you can create your message on the app and then click export, clicking export will generate a string that you can copy 
                    and send to friends. All your friends need to do is paste the encoded string into the decoder box and click decode and it will play the message. Currently there isn't any 
                    support for emojis or coloured text although i have plans to try to add support in the future. You can access the app from the link below or by going to the games/software 
                    section of the website. Thats all for now, happy messaging - Theo
