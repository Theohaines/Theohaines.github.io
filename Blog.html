        <H2>Long time, no see</H2>
        <H5>8th June 2022</H2>
        <P id="BlogParagraph">
           So its been a while, i haven't updated the blog 
           in a long time so its about time i give you guys an update.
           the 3D pipes screensaver has been cancelled due to limitations
           with unity and how 'good' i am at c# i will probally give it
           another try at some other point but for now its cancelled. As
           for the platformer i announced in my last blog post i am still
           working on it along with some smaller projects. i thought i would 
           have a build done alot sooner than i did. I'm Currently working on
           polising the game for a alpha release to get some feedback and
           ideas for new features. In news other than game development I'm
           working on a smart mirror and i will keep you guys posted on that.
           Thats all for now see you next time - Theo

        <H2>New game announcement</H2>
        <H5>16th may 2022</H2>
        <P id="BlogParagraph">
            Recently i started work on a new game which doesnt have a name yet, it is a 2d platformer shooter with a minimalistic look
            with all the game being built out of primitive shapes. The game will have an online leaderboard hosting the top 12 scores in game
            as well as a leaderboard on the website. This is the first game i am really proud of and I can't wait to share it with you 
            guys. I will create a itch.io page for the game soon and will release screenshots soon, I will also continue to update the game for
            the following months after the games release and will continue to fix and add new features. Thats all for now hope you are looking
            forward to it - Theo

            project - Theo.

        <H2>Introducing: VestaMessages</H2>
        <H5>7th may 2022</H2>
        <P id="BlogParagraph">
            I have created a new web app/ app for android called VestaMessages designed after the product VestaBoard. Using VestaMessages you can create VestaBoard style messages and 
            share them with friends. To send a message to a friend you can create your message on the app and then click export, clicking export will generate a string that you can copy 
            and send to friends. All your friends need to do is paste the encoded string into the decoder box and click decode and it will play the message. Currently there isn't any 
            support for emojis or coloured text although i have plans to try to add support in the future. You can access the app from the link below or by going to the games/software 
            section of the website. Thats all for now, happy messaging - Theo
