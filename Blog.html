            Remember the 3d pipes screensaver for windows 95? well i'm recreating it in the unity engine, i will release it
            in a few days and the project will be called "3D pipes". you can visit the project page using the link below and i 
            will post devlogs on the progress of the development for the next few days. The software will have several features 
            such as spawning multiple arrays of pipes and freecam around the map. Thats all for now can't wait to reveal the finished
            project - Theo.

        <H2>Introducing: VestaMessages</H2>
        <H5>7th may 2022</H2>
        <P id="BlogParagraph">
            I have created a new web app/ app for android called VestaMessages designed after the product VestaBoard. Using VestaMessages you can create VestaBoard style messages and 
            share them with friends. To send a message to a friend you can create your message on the app and then click export, clicking export will generate a string that you can copy 
            and send to friends. All your friends need to do is paste the encoded string into the decoder box and click decode and it will play the message. Currently there isn't any 
            support for emojis or coloured text although i have plans to try to add support in the future. You can access the app from the link below or by going to the games/software 
            section of the website. Thats all for now, happy messaging - Theo
        </P>

            <ul>
                <li>Devlogs</li>
                <li>General news</li>

            </ul>
            You can access the Blog page from the blog button on the website header or you can see the latest blog on the website homepage. To be honest i didn't think i'd accatually
            end up using the domain in the end but apparently i did and were here now. I will probally also add to the website as time goes on if you have any suggestions feel free
            to contact me using the contact page on the website. Thats all for now i think thanks for reading - Theo
