        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h2>
            Hello I am Theo Haines I am a web-developer and photographer from the uk, I enjoy working on websites and (hopefully) making them look good.
            I've worked on various projects such as Totem Social and One in the hole, I mostly work on the front end of the websites I make but sometimes
            I dabble in back end developement aswell. My latest project is petridish a simple life simulation game where you observe a petridish of bacteria
            and my favourite project I've worked on is Totem Social because it was really challenging to design a sleek and user friendly interface. On this website
            I have a showcase of some of the things I've done on my portfolio page, links to some of the projects I've worked on in the projects page and ways
            to contact me on the contact page. - Theo H
