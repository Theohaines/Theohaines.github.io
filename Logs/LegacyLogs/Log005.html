        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG005] New game announcement - 16/05/22</h2>

        <p> Recently i started work on a new game which doesnt have a name yet, it is a 2d platformer shooter with a minimalistic look
            with all the game being built out of primitive shapes. The game will have an online leaderboard hosting the top 12 scores in game
            as well as a leaderboard on the website. This is the first game i am really proud of and I can't wait to share it with you 
            guys. I will create a itch.io page for the game soon and will release screenshots soon, I will also continue to update the game for
            the following months after the games release and will continue to fix and add new features. Thats all for now hope you are looking
            forward to it - Theo 
        </p>
