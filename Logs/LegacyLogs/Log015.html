        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG015] Website update - 02/11/22</h2>

        <p> Hello all sorry for taking the blog down for so long I've been working on improving the speed
            of pages as well as several other prodjects I'll talk about now.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Where have I been?</h2>

        <p> I've been working on several diffirent projects and college work such as my new 2D puzzle platformer prototype
            and the chic-O-land website for one of my college website aswell as various diffirent improvements.      
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Why did the blog go offline?</h2>

        <p> I decided to rework the blog and mainly the photo dumps, the main reason for this is the amount of
            photos on the blog was slowing down the blog page significantly, because of this I have decided to
            remove all images directly on the blog page and now the photos are hosted on a google drive.    
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Website changes</h2>

        <p> I have now made a sitemap page to allow users to access other unlisted pages on my site with ease whereas before
            users would need to know the URL to get directly to the page. You can access the sitemap using the button at the bottom
            of this blog post. I have also readded all old hosted webpages such as Lufton co and my Unit 10.2 website which are also
            accessability via the sitemap.   
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>What next?</h2>

        <p> Currently I am working on changes to the 2D puzzle platformer prototype which I hope to publish soon as well as an
            update to the 2D shooter. I also want to start working on some other surprises in the future which you will have to
            wait and see. Thats all for now sorry for keeping you waiting - Theo
        </p>
