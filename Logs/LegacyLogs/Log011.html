        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG011] 2D-Platformer 0.1.0 stable - 06/09/22</h2>

        <p> So i finally got around to finishing the 2D-Platformer project i started a few
            months back. The game features a few enemy types an online leaderboard (avaliable on .exe only)
            and a few minutes of playtime. I intend to add alot more replayability to the game later on but
            i really wanted to release the game to get some feedback and feature suggestions. You can play the
            game on itch.io or download the .exe to enable online leaderboard functions.  
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Planned features</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>More enemys</li>
            <li>Powerups</li>
            <li>Permerment upgrades</li>
            <li>and an in game soundtrack</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h2>Final notes</h2>

        <p> I will create a devlog for every major feature that gets released and also keep you guys included
            in the development process. Thats all for now i hope you guys have as much fun playing the game as
            i did making it - Theo
