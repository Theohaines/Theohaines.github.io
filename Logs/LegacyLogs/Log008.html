        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG008] Major website update 2 - 12/08/22</h2>

        <p> This is a blog post going over the several major updates the website has gotten front end and backend.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h2>Front end changes</h2>

        <p> The first major thing you will notice the second you open the website is the
            changes to the colour pallet. I have gone for a grey colour for the new website
            theme to make it appear more professional. The second major change is mobile support
            (mostly!) I have massively improved mobile accessability and made a few quality of life changes.
            Finally i have cleaned up alot of pages including the one you are on now and
            intend to make more QOL changes in the future.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Back end changes</h2>

        <p> I've made quite a few changes to the back end such as giving each page its own individual css
            file to reduce website load times aswell as removing files that the website nolonger uses. Overrall
            performance should have improved with this update so i hope the website is alot more enjoyable to use.
            Thats all for now have a good one - Theo
