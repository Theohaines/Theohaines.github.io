        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG001] First Post - 06/05/22</h2>

        <p>This is mainly just a test of the blog system i've made but i also want to list a few things that'll be posted here such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Devlogs</li>
            <li>General news</li>
            <li>Game assets</li>
            <li>and more!</li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can access the Blog page from the blog button on the website header or you can see the latest blog on the website homepage. To be honest i didn't think i'd accatually
            end up using the domain in the end but apparently i did and were here now. I will probally also add to the website as time goes on if you have any suggestions feel free
            to contact me using the contact page on the website. Thats all for now i think thanks for reading - Theo
