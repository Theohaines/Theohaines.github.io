        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG006] Long time, no see - 08/06/22</h2>

        <p> So its been a while, i haven't updated the blog 
            in a long time so its about time i give you guys an update.
            the 3D pipes screensaver has been cancelled due to limitations
            with unity and how 'good' i am at c# i will probally give it
            another try at some other point but for now its cancelled. As
            for the platformer i announced in my last blog post i am still
            working on it along with some smaller projects. i thought i would 
            have a build done alot sooner than i did. I'm Currently working on
            polising the game for a alpha release to get some feedback and
            ideas for new features. In news other than game development I'm
            working on a smart mirror and i will keep you guys posted on that.
            Thats all for now see you next time - Theo
        </p>
