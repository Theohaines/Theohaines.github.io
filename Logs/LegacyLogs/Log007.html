        <h2>[LEGACY|LOG007] GameDev and Soap - 26/07/22</h2>

        <p> Its been quite some time since I last updated the blog and the
            website in general. Since the last blog post i've added a new
            music tab to the website which showcases all the the playlists i've
            made and will also host any music i make aswell. I'm planning on adding
            a photography page to the website to showcase some photos i've taken on my
            camera as well as some information on where they where taken and when.
            I'm also working on a small soap making business to bring in some extra cash
            so i'll keep you guys updated on that when its done. The reason i've been gone
            for a while is because I haven't been doing so well mentally recently
            and needed to take a break to clear my head. I'm going
            to get back to what i was doing before fairly soon so you guys should
            start seeing more games appear on the games page when that happens. Thats
            about all i have to say this time thanks for visiting my small corner of
            the internet cya next time - Theo.
