        <h2>[LOG003] New years resolution - 03/01/23</h2>

        <p>So my new years resolution is to make a new app every month, it doesn't matter what the app is it just needs to work and have a 'use', My first app is going to be
            a days since counter which rewards users by allowing them to slowly build their tower over time by keeping to their goal and not breaking the cycle. The app will
            be free to download on Android devices and possibly avaliable on windows devices (No IOS support sorry (Unless you wanna by me a macbook ;) )). I will post a link
            to the app on my software page aswell as create a Log to announce the launch. Can't wait to show you guys the progress - Theo 
        </p>
