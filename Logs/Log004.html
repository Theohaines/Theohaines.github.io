        <h2>[LOG004] The Tower Release [NEW YEARS 23 COLLECTION] - 13/01/23</h2>

        <p>Hello Again, I'm here today to announce the release of my first app for the twelve months of of apps new years resolution. The Tower is an app designed
            to help people reach their goals by allowing them to progress and build their own personal tower day by day, You can use the app for almost any goal you
            have in mind for example quitting smoking or helping quit self harm. I wanted the app to feel personal and thats why I added the tower building feature because
            it would make it feel more connected to the end user, If you end up breaking your streak the tower doesn't get destroyed because I feel like that would be 'mean',
            instead your 'streak' counter gets reset so you can start again but the tower remains. If a user does want to clear all their progress the option is there in the
            settings if need be. Only days the user logs into the app are counted towards the day counter because I feel like the user should have to be consistent in order
            to grow their tower. The app is currently available on Android only but I may work on a PC release in the future in a patch or feature update, I have included links
            to the download as well as the software page so you can check out all my apps and games. Thats all for now hope you enjoy - Theo Haines
