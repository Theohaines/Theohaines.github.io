        <h2>[LOG001] Website update 3.0 - 02/01/23</h2>

        <p>So its been quite a while since I last updated the website with some new content as well as given you guys a new blog post so I thought that the new year is the best
            time to do so (By the time you're reading this its probably past new years but its the thought that counts). So the first thing I should address is the complete
            overhall the websites design has had compared to the previous design. I felt like the website needed a new design change to give me a fresh canvas to work on and so I
            set to work by making a new design, I really liked the idea of the website constantly being in a 'dark mode' because it would make it easier to work on and look at
            during the night. I also wanted to simplify the design and make things look alot cleaner, doing this also helps when working on future projects [Side note legacy 
            content will also be converted to the new design at some point soon] because there is now a design standard for the website.
        </p>
        <p>I'm also in the process of converting all of the old blog posts to the now logs system and you'll see then here very soon hopefully, I've been wanting to rework the blog
            page for a while and now has given me the chance too. I felt it was very cluttered and didn't load well on older devices due too having alot of high quality images all
            load at the same time. I'm probably going to write a few 'notes' on the log system so keep an eye on those but thats all for now. I should hopefully update the logs more
            often than I used to now and I hope everyone enjoys the new website design thats all for now - Theo
