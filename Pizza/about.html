                Okay so basically we are a small team of 4 highly trained pizza making professionals. We started back in 2008 duing the great recession and somehow
                landed where we are today. Ever since we opened our company values have never changed we always strive to make the cheapest pizza at the lowest possible
                price nomatter the corners we have to cut. In our 25 or so years of service we have never let down the 'amazing' 'people' of Yeovil, And with 27 health and
                safety violations
